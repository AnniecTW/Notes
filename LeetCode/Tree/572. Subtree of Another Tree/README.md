üîó Link: [Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/description/)<br>

<hr>

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.<br>


Example 1:<br>
![subtree1-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5809621-10cc-400c-87bc-21904bd4be7b)


Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]<br>
Output: true<br>


Example 2:<br>
![subtree2-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/531ab984-c59e-41cc-9877-a4ad4280bcae)


Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]<br>
Output: false<br>


Constraints:<br>

- The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
- The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= root.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= subRoot.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Can `root` or `subRoot` be empty?
2. Any requirements on time/space complexity?
3. Happy path - Input: `root` = [0, null, 1], `subRoot` = [0, 1]; Output: false
4. Edge case - Input: `root` = [1, 1], `subRoot` = [1]; Output: true
5. Edge case - Input: `root` = [1], `subRoot` = [1]; Output: true

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
1. Tree / Recursion
   Use a inner recursive function to check if two trees are identical. If current `root` and `subRoot` are not identical, continue outer recursion into left and right children of current `root`
2. Serialization / Stringify (Optimized in run time)
   Transform tree of `root` and `subRoot` into string, simply check if the string of `subRoot` is a substring of `root`
   
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

#### Recursion
General Idea: Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level, storing values for each level in a temporary list

1) If `root` is empty, return `[]`
2) Initialize `res = []` and `queue = deque([root])`
3) While `queue` is not empty:<br>
   a) Set `level_size = len(queue)` to control the number of interatations for the current level<br>
   b) Initialize `level = []` to store nodes for current level<br>
   c) Iterate `level_size` times:<br>
      i) pop a node from `queue`, and append `node.val` to `level`
      ii) if `node` has left child, append it to queue
      iii) if `node` has right child, append it to queue
   d) append `level` to `res` after finishing iteration for the current level
4) Return `res`

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

Assume N represents the number of nodes

- Time Complexity: O(N)<br>
  Every node is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(N)<br>
  In the worst case, e.g. full binary tree, the queue may store up to N/2 nodes at the last level
