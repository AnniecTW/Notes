## 2013. Detect Squares
üîó Link: [Detect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/description/)<br>
üí° Difficulty: Medium<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Hash<br>

<hr>
You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:<br>
- **Adds** new points from the stream into a data structure. **Duplicate** points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
- Given a query point, **counts** the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an **axis-aligned** square with **positive area.**

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:<br> 
- `DetectSquares()` Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- `void add(int[] point)` Adds a new point `point = [x, y]` to the data structure.
- `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares with point `point = [x, y]` as described above.

  
Example 1:<br>

Input<br>
>["DetectSquares", "add", "add", "add", "count", "count", "add", "count"]<br>
>[[], [[3, 10]], [[11, 2]], [[3, 2]], [[11, 10]], [[14, 8]], [[11, 2]], [[11, 10]]]<br>

>[null, null, null, null, 1, 0, null, 2]<br>
<br>

Explanation<br>
>DetectSquares detectSquares = new DetectSquares();<br>
>detectSquares.add([3, 10]);<br>
>detectSquares.add([11, 2]);<br>
>detectSquares.add([3, 2]);<br>
>detectSquares.count([11, 10]); // return 1. You can choose: The first, second, and third points<br>
>detectSquares.count([14, 8]);  // return 0. The query point cannot form a square with any points in the data structure.<br>
>detectSquares.add([11, 2]);    // Adding duplicate points is allowed.<br>
>detectSquares.count([11, 10]);<br>
>// return 2. You can choose:<br>
>//   - The first, second, and third points<br>
>//   - The first, third, and fourth points<br>


Constraints:<br>

- point.length == 2
- 0 <= x, y <= 1000
- At most 3000 calls in total will be made to `add` and `count`.

### UMPIRE Method:
#### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Any requirements on time/space complexity?<br>
2. Happy path -<br>
   Input:<br>
   ```python
   DetectSquares detectSquares = new DetectSquares();
   detectSquares.add([-2, -2]);
   detectSquares.add([2, 2]);
   detectSquares.add([-2, 2]);
   detectSquares.count([2, -2]);
   ```
   Output: `1`<br>

4. Edge case -<br>
   Input:<br>
   ```python
   DetectSquares detectSquares = new DetectSquares();
   detectSquares.add([0, 0]);
   detectSquares.add([0, 0]);
   detectSquares.add([0, 0]);
   detectSquares.count([0, 0]);
   ```
   Output: `0`<br>

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
1. X-Y coordinate / Hash map
   - Use Python's built-in function `defaultdict` to record the frequencies and coordinates of the points.
   - Use square property to find valid squares: for a given point, find another point with the same X-coordinate, then the coordinates of other two points can be calculated.
   
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

General Idea: Use nested `collections.defaultdict` to count the points' frequencies. To count how many squares exist for a given point, find another point in `defaultdict` with the same X-coordinate, then the coordinates of other two points can be calculated. <br>

1) `from collections import defaultdict`
2) Create a nested defaultdict to count each point's frequency
   ```python
   class DetectSquares:

    def __init__(self): self.pointCount = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
   ```
4) 
   ```python
   def add(self, point: List[int]) -> None:
        self.pointCount[point[0]][point[1]] += 1
   ```
   
6) `magazine_count = Counter(magazine)`
7) Iterate each character (key) and its frequency (value) in `ransom_count.items()`
   - if the frequency of the corresponding character in `magazine_count` is less, return `False`
8) If all the charaters pass, return `True`
    
### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

see solution.py

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

Assume N is the length of `ransomNote`, and M is the length of `magazine`

- Time Complexity: O(N + M)<br>
  Counter` scans through `ransomNote` and `magazine` once, resulting in linear time.<br>
- Space Complexity: O(N + M)<br>
  In the worst case, all characters are unique, so two separate counters may store up to N + M elements.<br>
  If there is only lowercase English letters, this can be considered O(1).<br>
